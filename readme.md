## Test automation with Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup4 and Behave

Adapted implementation based on the article by Joao Victor Barreto on [GeekHunter](https://blog.geekhunter.com.br/automatizando-testes-com-python-selenium-e-behave) blog.

In order to run the project, clone the project and (inside the directory root) run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, run `behave`.
